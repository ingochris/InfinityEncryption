# InfinityEncryption

## Purpose
To promote encryption education.

## Why is powerful Cryptography so important?
Cryptography keeps us safe. 

It secures many of our everyday activities, such as communication (i.e. through cell-phones or e-mail), secure e-commerce (i.e. online purchases and other financial transfers), among many others. Some less-known, but just-as-important uses include avoiding file-corruption and virus transfers, and protecting the anonymity of whistle-blowers.

With cryptography, we can minimize our risk of being deceived and exploited. 

## What InfinityEncryption does
This tool registers coordinate values from live Synaptics' Telegraphe Touch Sensor development module inputs, then maps them to computer cursor positioning through the windows API, thus adding cursor "teleportation" to programs that utilize mouse-movement based cipher seeds, such as GPG, OpenSSL, and TrueCrypt. The new cursor teleportation feature further enhances entropy of PRNG algorithm seeds to generate public/private encryption and decryption keys.
